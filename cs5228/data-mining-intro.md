# Introduction to Data Mining

## Data Preparation

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- Access Data Quality
- Get to know your data

> if EDA is suspicious, might not mean that data is wrong!

### Data Preprocessing

- Improving Data quality 
  - "Garbage in, garbage out"
- Generate valid input for data mining Algorithms
- Remove complexity from data to ease processing


## Types of Data

1. Nominal
2. Ordinal
3. Interval
4. Ratio

> The kind of data is also subjective, depending on the use case.
> For example, level of education can be considered ordinal, but it may also be considered nominal if the value of the data is only for categorizing.
