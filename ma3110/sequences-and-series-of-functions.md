# Sequences and Series of Functions

## Sequence of Functions

Let $E \subseteq \R$

Suppose for each $n \in \N$, we have a function $f_n : E \rightarrow \R$.
Put these functions together to form a sequence

$$(f_n) = (f_1, f_2, ..., f_n)$$

We say that **$(f_n)$ is a sequence of functions on $E$**.
