# Science of Biology

## What is Science?

A systematic study of living and non-living observable natural universe - origins, structures, mechanisms

Basic set of assumptions

- All events have natural causes governed by natural laws 
- Rational observers perceive natural events in similar and objective manner 
- Natural laws can be discovered by systematic observation and experimentation - scientific method

### Scientific Method

Observation about a specific phenomenon or natural event leads to questions.

Question leads to hypothesis, which are formed as a testable prediction.

### Good Experimental Design

- Examines contribution of a _single_ specific factor - experimental variable
- Single variable not often possible - particularly with human subjects
- Test group - exposed to experimental variable
- Control group - not exposed to experimental variable
- Sample size - larger size minimizes sampling error
- Results - should be objective and reproducible by others

## What is Life?

Characteristics of Life

### Organized

All life on Earth can be organized in a hierarchical organization.

- Each level of organization is more complex than the preceding level
- Each level exhibits new emergent properties

For example, a sheet of endothelial cells that roll together forms a capillary which has the emergent property of carrying blood.

All organisms can all be categorised into 3 major groups

1. Domain Bacteria
2. Domain Archaea
3. Domain Eukarya
   1. Kingdom Fungi
   2. Kingdom Plantae
   3. Kingdom Animalia
   4. Protists

> Some physical or behavioural change must occur to be considered "adaptation"
