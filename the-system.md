# The System

## Values

Values are constantly changing.
Setbacks in life gives us the chance to re-evaluate which values are worth pursuing.

Values that matter to me right now:

- Compassion
- Discipline
- Conscientiousness

Of course, out of these 3, discipline is always the problem.

> You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

Therefore the ultimate goal right now, is to dissociate emotion from achievement, and to attain discipline without willpower.

## Starting from Ground Zer0

There will always be times where we have to start all over again.
The cycle of breakdown and rebuilding happens so many times, we should set ourselves up to minimize the downtime and maximize the uptime.

### Climbing out of the Pit

During depression and anxiety, we should be very careful in identifying TRAPs.

These are responses that does not serve to solve the issue at hand, which includes ruminating.
Rumination is recurrent thinking about self, mood, and negative events, with particular emphasis on the causes, consequences and meanings of these themes.
While the goal is to understand what happened and work out how to combat the upsetting feelings more effectively, 
we might want to talk to someone about it and write down the feelings instead.

Indeed we seem to run through the same thoughts and the feelings associated with it unless we pen them down. 

After we have decided that there are no lessons that can be applicable or that we are merely making conjectures without any real way of proving it, then it is clear cut that continuing to think of it is purely rumination.

#### Alternative Coping

- If there are certain situations or times of day when you're more likely to ruminate or worry, consider alternative environments or activities that make this type of thinking less likely
- Be mindful, noticing when you're ruminating or worrying and letting it pass by
- If you do feel you need to explore the issues you're concerned about, either use writing or talk to someone supportive who you trust
- Don't just mull things over in your head
- Physical activity

### Working with Emotions

When tackling something tough, it is always hard to get started.
Especially if you are only responsible for yourself.

The only thing that can allow you to get started is to break the goal all the way down.
We need a lot more small wins, and we do this by coming up with a "2min" variant of the goal we find so hard to tackle.

#### Behavioral System

- Keep the focus small
  - Have only 1 or 2 goals
- Make constant contact with the goal
- Forgive yourself for taking time off a tough pattern to maintain
- Make it easier

## Reparenting Yourself

There are some broken core beliefs that we identify with, and require some work to fix

- "There is something wrong with me"
- "People will always leave"

We can see that these beliefs clearly give rise to the self-critical and pessimistic personality that I have.
Perhaps while we are not in emotional deficit, we read less into the behavior of close friends and family. 
However the end goal here is to become completely secure in myself during the emotional setbacks as well.
It is worth noting that even though we have not achieved this state, nor might we be able to, 
there is nothing wrong with not meeting this goal.
