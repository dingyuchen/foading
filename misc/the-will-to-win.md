# The Will to Win

- Berton Braley

If you want a thing bad enough

To go out and fight for it,

Work day and night for it,

Give up your time and your peace

And your sleep for it,

----------

If only desire for it 

Makes you quite mad enough

Never to tire of it,

Makes you hold all other things tawdry 

And cheap for it

----------

If life seems all empty

And useless without it 

And all that you scheme

And you dream is about it

----------

If you'll gladly sweat for it,

Fret for it, plan for it,

Lose all your terror of God

or man for it.

----------

If you'll simply go after that

thing that you want

With all your capacity,

Strength, and sagacity,

Faith, hope, and confidence,

stern pertinacity,

----------

If neither cold poverty,

famished and gaunt,

Nor sickness nor pain

Of body and brain

Can turn you away from

the thing that you want,

----------

If dogged and grim you

besiege and beset it,

You'll get it.
