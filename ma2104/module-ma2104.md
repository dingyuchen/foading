# Multivariable Calculus

#entry

## Module Information
Lectures will be pre-recorded and uploaded every Tuesday and Friday before 12pm in multimedia.

Focus of the lectures will be on the **mathematical concepts and proofs**.

Tutorials will alternate between _lecture on a topic_ (part of tested materials) and _discussion of the homework problems_.

Tutorials are also pre-recorded and uploaded on Luminus before Wednesday, 2pm.

## Assessment

| Test        | Weightage |
| ----------- | --------- |
| 5x Homework | 40%       |
| Finals      | 60%       |
