# Maxwell Equations

1. $$\oint_S \vec E \circ \hat n \; ds = \frac{q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0}$$

Electric charge produces an electric field, and the flux of that field passing through any closed surface is proportional to the total charge contained within that surface.

$S = \partial D$ is a closed surface

$q_{enc}$ is the total amount of charge contained within that surface

$e_0$ is the permittivity of free space

$\vec E$ is the electric field, the electrical force per unit charge exerted on a charged object.
